# Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) has made substantial advances in the past few years due to the success of modern techniques 
that are based on deep learning. With the rise of the popularity of NLP and the availability of different forms of 
large-scale data, it is now even more imperative to understand the inner workings of NLP techniques and concepts, 
from first principles, as they find their way into real-world usage and applications that affect society at large. 
Building intuitions and having a solid grasp of concepts are both important for coming up with innovative techniques, 
improving research, and building safe, human-centered AI and NLP technologies
