# Real-or-Not-NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets

This is a Kaggle competiton. In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about 
real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

# What should I expect the data format to be?

Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:

 * The "text" of a tweet
 * A "keyword" from that tweet (although this may be blank!)
 * The "location" the tweet was sent from (may also be blank)
 
 # What am I predicting?
 
 You are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.
